/* Explanation of Each Directive
@tailwind base:
index .css is used for global styling 
Adds Tailwind's base styles, which include CSS resets and normalization styles.
These styles ensure consistent rendering across different browsers and provide a clean slate for your project.
Example:
css
Copy code
html {
  line-height: 1.5;
  -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;
}
@tailwind components:

Includes predefined component classes provided by Tailwind, such as buttons, cards, forms, etc., which you can extend or customize.
These are reusable styles that can speed up development.
@tailwind utilities:

Loads utility classes like text-center, bg-blue-500, p-4, etc., which you use to style your elements directly in your markup.
This is the core of the utility-first CSS approach that Tailwind promotes. */
